# reddit-tv-bot
Reddit bot that private messages a specified user when a new TV sale is posted to r/buildapcsales

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- IDE of your choice to run the application
- praw: run "pip install praw" in the terminal

## Running the application

Import the project into your IDE of choice (I use Visual Studio Code).
The user will need to enter the username and password of the bot account they create on Reddit, as well as the username of the reddit account to send the private message to.
The file will need to be running to scan for new r/buildapcsales posts and private message the user.
